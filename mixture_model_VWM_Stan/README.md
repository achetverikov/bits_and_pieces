This is an example code for Zhang & Luck's mixture model of VWM implementation in Stan / R. 

- unbiased_mix_with_swaps.stan - Stan code for the mixture model with 2 components + guesses
- unbiased_mix_with_swaps_same_kappas.stan - Stan code for the mixture model with 2 components + guesses that assumes the same precision for the two components 
- example_Stan_mixture_with_swaps_and_guesses.R - R code simulating some example data and using cmdstanr to fit the models
